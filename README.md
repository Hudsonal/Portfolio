1. The problem I was trying to solve was to store and sort a collection of data using datastructures.
2. I approached this by using a vectore to store all the data in and sort the data in alphanumeric order. Data structures are important because of the 
basis that sometimes a database is not needed to store data in.
3. I overcame any roadblocks I had by reviewing the course content to ensure I was doing the coding espacially correct and referred to the tutors if need be
4. This work has expanded my approach on writing programs by showing me the a list is not always the best way to solve a data storage problem
5. my work has not fully evolved, as I have always made sure that my programs are readable, maintainable, and adaptable
